@GregAbbott_TXWell, more Texans dying of COVID will certainly distract from all the harm done to Texas by you and ERCOT during the winter storm.  Nice distraction tactic."

@GregAbbott_TXAbsolutely reckless and shows exactly the lengths you will go to in order to put us, fellow Texans, in harms way just to detract from the mess you all made with the energy disaster. We will remember this come election time."

@GregAbbott_TXIt makes sense to reopen & let the people try to salvage their lives, businesses, etc.  I do believe that it is wrong to expect Americans to be locked  down & yet our borders are not closed!!
